        <h2>Why this collection means so much to me</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, I have built an extraordinary collection of soccer things that shows my passion for the beautiful game. From autographed jerseys to limited-edition soccer balls, every item in this collection holds a <strong>special place in my heart</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have to make the difficult decision to sell some of these treasured items to pay my tuition bill. Even tho selling some of them is hard, I was lucky enough to keep my <em>special soccer ball used in a match back in my home country Syria</em>.
