    <h1>My collection of Soccer souvenirs</h1>
    <h2>Why this collection means so much to me</h2>
    <p>
        Over the years, I have built a  collection of soccer souvenirs that shows my passion for soccer. From autographed jerseys to limited-edition soccer balls, every item in this collection holds a <strong>special place in my heart</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>Making a tough choice</h2>
    <p>
        I have to sell some of those things I love to pay my tuition bill. I had to sell some of my limited-edition jerseys, but I was lucky and got to keep my <em>soccer ball used in a match back in my home country Syria</em>.
